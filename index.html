  <h1>Decision Trees, Reinforcement Learning, and Bayesian Models</h1>
  <h2>Decision Trees</h2>
  <p>Decision trees are a type of machine learning model that can be used to make decisions. They are made up of a series of nodes, each of which represents a decision point. The nodes are connected by branches, each of which represents a possible outcome of the decision. The decision tree is trained on a dataset of historical data, and it uses this data to learn how to make decisions that are likely to be correct.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Here is an example of a decision tree that can be used to decide whether or not to buy a new car.</p>
  <img src="decision-tree.png" alt="Decision Tree">
  <p>The first node in the decision tree asks the question, "Do you need a new car?" If the answer is yes, then the tree branches off to two possible outcomes: "Buy a new car" and "Don't buy a new car." If the answer is no, then the tree ends.</p>
  <p>The "Buy a new car" branch asks the question, "Can you afford a new car?" If the answer is yes, then the tree branches off to two possible outcomes: "Buy a new car" and "Don't buy a new car." If the answer is no, then the tree ends.</p>
  <p>The "Don't buy a new car" branch asks the question, "Can you afford to repair your old car?" If the answer is yes, then the tree branches off to two possible outcomes: "Repair your old car" and "Don't repair your old car." If the answer is no, then the tree ends.</p>
  <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
  <p>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning model that can be used to learn how to make decisions in an environment where the outcome of the decision is not known in advance. The model is trained on a dataset of historical data, and it uses this data to learn how to make decisions that are likely to lead to a positive outcome.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Here is an example of a reinforcement learning model that can be used to learn how to play a game of chess.</p>
  <p>The model is trained on a dataset of historical chess games. Each game in the dataset is represented as a sequence of moves. The model uses this data to learn how to evaluate the state of a chess board, and to select the move that is most likely to lead to a win.</p>
  <h2>Bayesian Models</h2>
  <p>Bayesian models are a type of machine learning model that can be used to make predictions about the probability of an event occurring. The model is trained on a dataset of historical data, and it uses this data to learn the probability of each event occurring.</p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Here is an example of a Bayesian model that can be used to predict the probability of rain.</p>
  <p>The model is trained on a dataset of historical weather data. Each data point in the dataset includes the date, the time, the temperature, and the amount of precipitation. The model uses this data to learn the probability of rain on each day of the year.</p>
  <p>The model can then be used to predict the probability of rain on a given day. For example, if the model predicts that there is a 70% chance of rain on a given day, then you can be 70% confident that it will rain on that day.</p>
